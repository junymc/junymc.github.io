I was born in early 1980's in Korea. Not much memories from 1980's but the Seoul Olympic in 1988 was a big thing. I heard after the Olympic, Korea started develope very fast. My dad had his own business so I had a pretty good childhood financially. I remember we had a big screen tv but it was really fat and heavy. I had this giant phone called "city phone"(early mobile device that could make calls like a cellphone, but could receive only small text messages as a beeper does.)  in the late 1990's. We were still using pager so people were lined up in front of the public phone to listen to their voice mail duirng the break time and had to run back to class when the bell goes off. I was lucky to use my city phone so I didn't have to deal with the lines or looking for coins. That was my first benefit of technology I think.

I bet everyone had a memory of choosing the background music and record their voice for the pager. Listening to music with walkman, recording favorite music from radio and sometimes accidently record the commercial too if I don't press the stop button in time. Those are really fun memories from 1990's.. Then we started having cell phones, just black and white text message and phone calls but no need to look for the public phones or carrying lot's of coins. At that time, we were just imagining looking at each other's face through cell phone and thought it can only happen in the movie. Or touch screen, flat tv.. Did you realize all these were invented in not even 20 years from that time? So crazy! Now, we can wear VR gogle and experience ourselves being in a game or a video. We have a car that doesn't need gas, or drive itself. These all the technolgy is developing so fast. Too fase actually. Of course there's a lot of benefits from it. Example, you can see your family who is in the other side of the world without flying for hours through the screen. Or, you can shop anything online and deliver it to your door in a day!

I draw pretty well with just a pencil but it takes hours to finish one person's face. With this technology, application from your phone can turn your picture to drawing in a second and it looks awesome. Who wants to wait for hours sitting in front of me? The technology makes things so easy and fast but no humanity. Soon, there will be no shopping mall or mall with no sales person just like the Amazon stroe. Kids are all about Youtube and palying Esports(video games), they don't want to go out paly real sports any more. 

I'm studying softwear engineering but it's hard to catch up all the changes. The more technology is developing, we are losing our humanity. Maybe like the movie Terminator, all the computer will control the world in the future. I like the convinience of technology but I miss the old time.
