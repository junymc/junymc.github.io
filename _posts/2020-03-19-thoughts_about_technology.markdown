I was born in Korea in the early 1980s. I donâ€™t have many memories from the 1980s, but I do remember that the 1988 Seoul Olympics were a big deal. After the Olympics, Korea started developing very fast. As a child, our family was financially secure because my dad owned his own business. I remember we had a big screen tv that was fat and heavy. I had a giant phone called a "city phone"(early mobile device that could make calls like a cellphone but could receive only small text messages as a beeper does.) in the late 1990s when I was in high school. Most people were still using pagers so students would line up in front of the public phone to listen to their voice mail during their breaks and then had to run back to class when the bell went off. I was lucky to have a city phone, so I did not have to deal with waiting in lines or carrying coins. That was my first true exposure to the benefits of technology.

I bet everyone had a memory of choosing the background music and record their voice for the pager. Listening to music with walkman, recording favorite music from radio and sometimes accidently record the commercial too if I don't press the stop button in time. Those are really fun memories from 1990's.. Then we started having cell phones, just black and white text message and phone calls but no need to look for the public phones or carrying lot's of coins anymore. At that time, we were just imagining looking at each other's face through cell phone and thought it can only happen in the movie. Or touch screen, flat tv.. Did you realize all these were invented in not even 20 years from that time? So crazy! Now, we can wear VR gogle and experience ourselves being in a game or a video. We have a car that doesn't need gas, or drive itself. These all the technolgy is developing so fast. Too fase actually. Of course there's a lot of benefits from it. Example, you can see your family who is in the other side of the world without flying for hours through the screen. Or, you can shop anything online and deliver it to your door in a day!

I draw pretty well with just a pencil but it takes hours to finish one person's face. With this technology, application from your phone can turn your picture to drawing in a second and it looks awesome. Who wants to wait for hours sitting in front of me? The technology makes things so easy and fast but no humanity. Soon, there will be no shopping mall or mall with no sales person just like the Amazon stroe. Kids are all about Youtube and palying E-sports(video games), they don't want to go out paly real sports any more. 

I'm studying softwear engineering but it's hard to catch up all the changes. The more technology is developing, we are losing our humanity. Maybe like the movie Terminator, all the computer will control the world in the future. I like the convinience of technology but I miss the old time.
