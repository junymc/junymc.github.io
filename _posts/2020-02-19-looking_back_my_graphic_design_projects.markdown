## Sessions College - *Graphic Design*
I always was interested in art and design. I wanted to go to Art High School when I was in Korea but my dad was really old fashion minded typical asian man who went against women working in those career field. So I had to stop dreaming to become a designer. But I couldn't give up learning design. And my husband was always supported my passion so he found this design school online just like he found me Flatiron school.
I had a 3 year old boy at that time and only has been in America for 4 years so with the limited time that I could have for studying and my language barrier were challenge to me but I really enjoyed and learned so much while I was in the program! I look back my projects sometimes and still proud of myself that I did all and finished the program in time. So I wanted to share some of my favorite projects here.

## Logo design
Typography was an interesting subject. I learned about different types of font families and each font depends on the typefaces, spacing and grid expresses many different ways and so effective for especially brand logo.

> [Typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography) is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed

Here are a few of my logo design.

## Megazine cover & spread
After learing about color theory, design and compositon, my assignment was creating a megazine cover and a spread. I was so excited and had so much fun while I was doing this project!
I'm not a big reader but I always love reading megazines and looking at pictures in the megazine. My favorite is fashion and interior megazine. I had a really hard time to deside which path I'm going to choose between fashion and interior when I was in high school. I ended up not going to either paths and became a house wife with kids but I still love those subjects.
