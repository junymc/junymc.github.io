## Sessions College - *Graphic Design*
I always was interested in art and design. I wanted to go to a High School that focused on Art & Design growing up in Korea,  but my dad was really old fashioned and was not open to me working in that industry. So my dream to study art was placed on hold, but I never lost my passion. My husband has always been supportive so researched into online web design schools. 

At the time I had a 3 year old boy and had only been in America for approximately four years. Even with the limited time I had to study and the difficulty of a language barrier I really enjoyed and learned so much through that program. Sometimes I look back on my projects and it makes me proud that I was able to complete the program with straight A's.
Listed below are some of my favorite projects:


## Logo design
Typography was an interesting subject. I learned about different types of font families and depends on the typefaces, spacing and grid expresses many different ways and so effective for especially brand logo.

Here are a few of my logo designs for a magazine I created using Adobe Illustrator.

## Magazine cover & spread

After learning about color theory, design, and composition my first assignment was to create a magazine cover and spread. I'm not the biggest fan of reading, but I enjoy reading articles from magazines and browsing through pictures. 
My favorite magazines are either fashion or interior design. 

This is my final cover and spread.

When I designed this magazine cover my goal was to catch someone's eye if it was on the shelf of a book store or magazine booth. To do this I used a strong image to attract consumers and bright color to give contrast against the dark background. The spread was designed around the photo of the model. I used a font that was not too strong so that it did not distract the reader from the subject.  


## Packaging

Even walking through the aisle of a grocery store there are many diffent designs that are used so it's hard to judge a product by packaging alone. My next assignment was to design the label for an olive oil company. When I thought of olive oil the color green, nature, and freshshness came to mind. So I chose my color theme with those images in mind.

Using different color themes for different flavors, consumers can imagine the taste of the oil. For example, color the red gives the image of spiciness.

Below is the final product:

## Conclusion

I was skilled at traditional art using pencils, but there was definititely an enjoyable learning curve with Adobe Illustrator. 
It's been nearly five years since I graduated from Sessions College and the projects are kind of old now, but I can still imagine this image being used on a bottle of olive oil displayed on the shelf of a store. A good design is timeless.
