## Sessions College - *Graphic Design*
I always was interested in art and design. I wanted to go to Art High School when I was in Korea but my dad was really old fashion minded typical asian man who went against women working in those career field. So I had to stop dreaming to become a designer. But I couldn't give up learning design. And my husband was always supported my passion so he found this design school online just like he found me Flatiron school.
I had a 3 year old boy at that time and only has been in America for 4 years so with the limited time that I could have for studying and my language barrier were challenge to me but I really enjoyed and learned so much while I was in the program! I look back my projects sometimes and still proud of myself that I did all and finished the program in time. So I wanted to share some of my favorite projects here.

## Logo design
Typography was an interesting subject. I learned about different types of font families and each font depends on the typefaces, spacing and grid expresses many different ways and so effective for especially brand logo.

> [Typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography) is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.  - Wikipedia

Here are a few of my logo design.

## Megazine cover & spread
After learing about color theory, design and compositon, my assignment was creating a megazine cover and a spread. I was so excited and had so much fun while I was doing this project!
I'm not a big reader but I always love reading megazines and looking at pictures in the megazine. My favorite is fashion and interior megazine. I had a really hard time to deside which path I'm going to choose between fashion and interior when I was in high school. I ended up not going to either paths and became a house wife with kids but I still love those subjects. 

This is my fianl cover and spread.

When I designed this megazine, I wanted it to catch people's eye on the shlef in the book store or megazine booth. So I used strong image that attract you and bright yellow color of logo to give a contrast aginst the darker background so it pops up more. The spread was designed along with the photo of the model. The choice of font was not too strong to take the reader's eyes aways from the model but helps the reader to read easily about the model. I used the same color theme, yellow and white font but on the blue beach backround gives different effect then the gray background on the cover. 

## Packaging
There are so many different designs out there. Even in the grocery store, you will see so many different labels on the bottles on the shelf when you walk pass sauces or drinks section. My next assignment was designing a packaging for olive oil. The first thing that popped up in my head after the word "olive oil" was green, nature, fresh.. those words. So I choose my color theme with those images that I pictured in my head. Then I thought about the logo that would give quality image. Somthing like organic and honest brand iamge.
