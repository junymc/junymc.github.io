## Adventure Challenge
Whoo.. 4 weeks of this journey with React/Redux project is finally done! I feel like it was way longer than 4 weeks.. As always, I started with struggle and ended with gaining lots of knowledge from it.

I got this idea from a book that I received as a gift from my husband for our anniversary. The book is about doing things that I scratch off from the list and putting pics as the proof. My App is the same concept. I have adventure list and it won't show exactly what it is till the user scratchs off the adventure. Then the user can see the name and description of the adventure and can post an evidnece with a photo.

I built this App with React/Redux Frontend and Rails API Backend.
