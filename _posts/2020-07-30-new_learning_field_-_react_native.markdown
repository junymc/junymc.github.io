After studing React.js from Flatiron School, I faced myself with wider field of React which is React Native. React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. React is targeting browser but React Native is targeting mobile platforms like iOS and Android. Just like React, React Native applications are written using a mixture of JavaScript and JSX(XML-esque markup). Also the update cycle in React Native is the same as in React: when props or state change, React Native re-renders the views. Therefore, React Native is easier for me to understand with my existing knowledge of React than other libraries. One of differences between React Native and React in the browser is that React Native does this by leveraging the UI libraries of its host platform, rather than using HTML and CSS.
