After graduating Flatiron School, I've been trying to find more things to study to extend my skills. There are so many languages and framworks that people are using to develop web applications. I had to chose which one I'm going to start with. One day, I was at the restaurant with my husband and looked around. Most of people who are in the restaurant are holding a fork in one hand and holding a phone in other hand. People can't leave their phone even while they are eating! 
And hence, there comes the REACT Native Development in the picture! Since I loved learning React and still there's more to learn about it, I decided to move my next step of learning field to React Native.


### What is React Native
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. React is targeting browser but React Native is targeting mobile platforms like iOS and Android. Just like React, React Native applications are written using a mixture of JavaScript and JSX(XML-esque markup). Also the update cycle in React Native is the same as in React: when props or state change, React Native re-renders the views. Therefore, React Native is easier for me to understand with my existing knowledge of React than other libraries. One of differences between React Native and React in the browser is that React Native does this by leveraging the UI(user interface) libraries of its host platform, rather than using HTML and CSS. 
With React Native Framework, you can render UI for both iOS and Android platforms, means, Just code once, and the REACT Native apps are available for both iOS and Android platforms which helps to save development time.
