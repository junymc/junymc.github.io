After studing React.js from Flatiron School, I faced myself with wider field of React which is React Native. 

## What is React Native
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. React is targeting browser but React Native is targeting mobile platforms like iOS and Android. Just like React, React Native applications are written using a mixture of JavaScript and JSX(XML-esque markup). Also the update cycle in React Native is the same as in React: when props or state change, React Native re-renders the views. Therefore, React Native is easier for me to understand with my existing knowledge of React than other libraries. One of differences between React Native and React in the browser is that React Native does this by leveraging the UI(user interface) libraries of its host platform, rather than using HTML and CSS. 
With React Native Framework, you can render UI for both iOS and Android platforms, means, Just code once, and the REACT Native apps are available for both iOS and Android platforms which helps to save development time.
