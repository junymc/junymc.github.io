Finally I moved another step closer to become a programmer! Everytime I do my project, I feel like "This is the hardest one!" but after I start a new project, the hardest one changes to the new one. Not because I said that, this javascript project is definately the hartest one. Even though while I was in the half way, I was still confused and wasn't sure why I needed this function, what these classes do... Hopefully, I can understand more about javascript after I go over about my project writing this blog.
