Finally I moved another step closer to become a programmer! Everytime I do my project, I feel like "This is the hardest one!" but after I start a new project, the hardest one changes to the new one. Not because I said that, this javascript project is definately the hartest one. Even though while I was in the half way, I was still confused and wasn't sure why I needed this function, what these classes do... Hopefully, I can understand more about javascript after I go over about my project writing this blog.

## Backend - Rails API
I have two models for this API. Brand class and Shoe class. Their relationship is `has_many` and `belongs_to`. 
The controllers have some basic CRUD actions render to json. 
This APP uses Rack CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making cross-origin AJAX possible.
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new and popular technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.

## Frontend
### HTML
This app starts the page with basic elements in HTML. Head with style links and script links to all the files. Body with all the brand logo images and new shoe form. As the javascript function creates more elemnts and depends the user's action, the HTML will change and so does the page.

### CSS
I'm still new to making fancy, stylish web page but I love this part mostly! Since I already finished a course for Graphic Design, changing colors of elements, choosing a font style and deciding layouts are so fun work to me. I'm not good at it yet but I really like to know more about it till I'm good!
