I finally compeleted my very first project! Initially I was scared to bulid a working program from scratch by myself.  I felt as if I was droped onto an island left with just a knife and an empty backpack.  I had zero idea of how to start or where to start with expectations of me building a shelter, and to hunt for my own survival.  I was lost, but luckily I had the support of some good friends willing to take their time to assist me through the process. Slowly, I began to understand more about the CLI (Command Line Interface) and how to start working on a functioning application. 

I wrote a note of what I'm going to build, thought about its concept, and how it was to interact with users. My app for this project was an app that lists events taking place in Las Vegas. Users input what event they would like to see from a list that is produced and it outputs more detailed information from the selected event such as available date, time, location, and pricing information. 

Here is how I built my CLI ruby gem. 

## Using Bundler to Set Up My Ruby Gem:
I repeatedly watched Avi's video and ran through his guide to set up my folders and files using `Bundler`. `Bundler` provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed. It was pretty easy way to create a new gem just typing in `bundle gem LasVegas_event`.
It creates a gem with a README, .gemspec, Rakefile and directory structure.

## Setting Up My Environment:
The hardest part was ensuring that all requirements were met and that code could be executed and produce the right information. In order to do that, I had to add all the `require` files/installed gems in my environment file. 

Once all the files were set up, all that was left for me to focus on was the part I enjoy the most and that's coding. After days of struggle I was able to get my code to finally run successfully and this boosted my confidence. 

but took a while to complete because I was juggling with completing the project and moving to my new home. I know if I had more time I would be able to produce a finer product and I learned a lot from this experience having to start alone and kind of lost in the process. It felt great to complete it though and that's why I enjoy challenges. The feeling of accomplishing something so difficult especially for someone like me who has zero coding background and a language barrier. I expect this journey to be one of struggle, but filled with rewards of accomplishment.
